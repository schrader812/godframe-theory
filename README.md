# The Godframe Theory

This repository contains the full theory, LaTeX source, and simulation-backed validation of the Godframe Echo Field â€” a scalar-field-based cosmological model unifying expansion, gravity, and dark matter.

## Contents

- `paper/`: LaTeX source and PDF for the full theory
- `simulations/`: Placeholder for scalar field simulations and data (to be added)
- `figures/`: Plots showing results of activation, freezeout, halo suppression, and residual curvature
