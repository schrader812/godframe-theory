\title{The Godframe Theory: From Relativistic Activation to Echo Field Dark Matter}

\begin{abstract}
We present the Godframe Theory, a unified scalar field cosmological framework in which
a relativistically activated scalar field governs the origin of curvature, expansion, and dark
matter. The scalar field is activated when a frame-dependent energy invariant \(\Xi\) exceeds a
critical Planck-scale threshold \(\Xi_c = \frac{c^5}{G}\). After activation, the field drives curvature and structure,
then deactivates and freezes into a residual, gravitationally active form called the Echo Field.
We derive the theory from first principles, formulate its covariant Lagrangian, and validate all
key components through numerical simulation. This paper establishes the Godframe scalar as
a viable origin of time, inflation, black hole behavior, and cold dark matter.

\section{Introduction}
The Godframe Theory introduces a conditionally activated scalar field governed by a novel relativistic invariant:
\[
\Xi = \gamma \cdot \frac{m^2 c^3}{\hbar}
\]

\section{Covariant Formulation}
\[
\Xi = \frac{T^{\mu\nu} u_\mu u_\nu}{\hbar}
\]

\section{Scalar Field Lagrangian}
\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - \frac{\lambda}{4} (\phi^2 - \phi_0^2)^2 \cdot \left[\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(\Xi - \Xi_c)}}\right]
\]

\section{Flashpoint Cosmology}
Activation occurs when \(\Xi \geq \Xi_c\), initiating expansion and replacing inflation with a threshold-triggered scalar burst.

\section{Black Hole Edge Activation}
Scalar field reactivates near Schwarzschild radius where \(\gamma \to \infty\), steepening curvature.

\section{Freezeout and CDM Behavior}
After deactivation, simulations confirm:
\[
\rho_\phi \propto a^{-3}
\]

\section{Halo Suppression}
Simulations show reduced halo formation from Echo Field seeds compared to Gaussian ΛCDM.

\section{Residual Curvature}
Even after φ freezes, the potential energy \(V(\phi_s)\) sources gravity:
\[
\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G V(\phi_s)
\]

\section{Equation of State}
\[
w = \frac{\langle (\nabla \phi)^2 - V(\phi) \rangle}{\langle V(\phi) \rangle} \Rightarrow w_\text{eff} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\section{Conclusion}
Godframe unifies scalar activation, expansion, dark matter, and black hole behavior into one simulation-tested framework.
